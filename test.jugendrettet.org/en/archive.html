<h3>FREE IUVENTA - SEA RESCUE IS NOT A CRIME</h3>

<h4>JUGEND RETTET - IUVENTA</h4>

<p>JUGEND RETTET is a network of young people who have organized themselves to fight against dying in the Mediterranean. We bought a ship, the IUVENTA, and have already saved more than 14,000 people from distress. In this way, we are countering the humanitarian catastrophe and collective European failure. <br />
On the 1st of August, the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) ordered the IUVENTA to Lampedusa. Subsequently, it was seized by Italian authorities. The day before, we refused to sign the so-called Code of Conduct of the Italian government, which would have forced us to break international maritime law.</p>

<h4>CRIMINALISATION OF SEA RESCUE</h4>

<p>The aim of European migration policy is to close the <a href="https://blamingtherescuers.org/">humanitarian corridor</a>. In order to achieve this, the NGOs active in the Mediterranean will be kept from rescue operations. The situation escalated in a campaign of slander and criminalisation, which falsely accused us of co-operation with smugglers. <br />
As a rescue organisation, we observe the instructions of the responsible authority, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, in Italy. Our rescue missions are based on <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seenotrettung">international maritime law</a> and are based on internationally recognised humanitarian principles. <br />
The Italian prosecutor's office uses statements and <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/08/05/news/migranti_iuventa_inchiesta_defend_europe_salvini_saviano_famiglia_cristiana-172429351/">accusations from right-wing circles</a> with the intention of sealing off fortress Europe even more brutally at its external borders. Dubious evidence from the sphere of the right-wing extremist Identitarian movement is used in the <a href="https://www.woz.ch/1733/seenotrettung/eskalation-auf-hoher-see">politically motivated campaign</a> against the NGOs.</p>

<h4>EUROPEAN AID TO BREACH INTERNATIONAL LAW</h4>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/libyen-schwach-und-selbstbewusst-1.3628124">Libyan civil war</a> various militia are fighting for power. The so-called Libyan coast guard is part of a civil war division and is supported by European states. This Libyan coast guard, under threat of violence, prohibits the unauthorised travel on international waters, and <a href="http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2017-08/seenotrettung-fluechtlinge-mittelmeer-libysche-kuestenwache-ngos/komplettansicht">disregards applicable and established sea and international law</a>. People who are apprehended when crossing to Europe end up in <a href="http://www.msf.ch/de/news/artikel/detail/eu-regierungen-stuetzen-libyens-geschaeft-mit-dem-leiden/">detention camps with catastrophic conditions</a>, are subjected to massive violence, and human rights violations. Last year more than five thousand people were been killed while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<h4>SUPPORT</h4>

<p>Europe does not accept any responsibility for the indescribable suffering at our external borders, and neither allows safe escape routes nor state rescue programs. Instead, the European states are now financing the people who were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-libya-italy-exclusive/exclusive-armed-group-stopping-migrant-boats-leaving-libya-idUSKCN1B11XC">ruthless smugglers</a> yesterday, so that they can stop those fleeing over the crossing today. Meanwhile, we are prevented from documenting the humanitarian catastrophe with our rescue missions and from saving human lives. However, we will not stop criticising the <a href="https://www.proasyl.de/news/krieg-gegen-schlepper-krieg-gegen-fluechtlinge/">deadly logic</a> of European migration policy.
Now, more than ever, we are dependent on your support! Show your solidarity and raise your voice for us. You can help us through small actions: share our message! Get in touch with us - with a comment or a banner. <br />
Only together can we make it possible for the IUVENTA to save lives.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>

<h4><strong>2018/12/16</strong>: Meeting of Jugend Rettet IUVENTA embassies</h4>

<p>Good if you can laugh at yourself #foreveryoung <br />
A wonderful weekend in Hanover comes to an end: since Friday, ambassadors from more than 10 cities have jointly evaluated the last months, discussed and forged plans for the new year. We have fueled up to defy the current abuses and the escalating criminalization. A big thank you to all our fantastic messages that bring Jugend Rettet IUVENTA to life! &lt;3</p>

<p><img src="../f/images/archive/20181216_001.jpg" alt="Ambassadors in front of store &quot;Baby Store&quot;" title="Ambassadors in front of store 'Baby Store'" /></p>

<h4><strong>2018/12/13</strong>: Nomination for Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by European Parliament</h4>

<p>Common Statement: <br />
As search and rescue organisations, we are grateful that thanks to the initiative of the Socialists and
Democrats Group, we were nominated for the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. This nomination
is acknowledging the vital role which NGOs have played in saving human lives during the past years. Last
year alone, NGOs have conducted about 40% of the rescues in the Central Mediterranean. <br />
This year constitutes an extraordinary year for the protection of human rights - and simultaneously their
devaluation - as it marks the 70th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. However, in light
of current EU migration policies, there is no cause for celebration. Over 2.100 people died this year, trying
to reach safety in Europe. EU member states should use this anniversary to evaluate European migration
policies with regards to the values agreed by the international community after the atrocities of the
Second World War. <br />
As NGOs, it is our role to critically remind the EU member states of the deadly consequences of their
policies and of their legal responsibilities, and to shed light on human rights violations taking place in the
Central Mediterranean at this very moment. <br />
We are representing European civil society and jointly stand for and defend the most basic principle of all:
every single life is of equal value and worth saving.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/26</strong>: Solidary greetings from Ut-Vitam</h4>

<p>We received solidary greetings from the NGO <a href="http://www.utvitam-togo.org/">Ut-Vitam</a> from Togo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/456315244517006/photos/a.760159144132613/1140273552787835/">Photo and Greeting</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/24</strong>: IUVENTA crew nominated for International Maritime Rescue Federation award</h4>

<p>While 10 of our crew members are under investigation in Italy, the entire crew of our IUVENTA was nominated for their outstanding contribution to civil service by the International Maritime Rescue Federation - IMRF. <br />
This recognition of commitment and professionalism makes us especially happy at this very moment, when investigations are ongoing against our volunteers, ships are being seized and the SAR NGOs are being used as scapegoats for a failed migration policy.</p>

<p><img src="../f/images/archive/20181124_001.jpg" alt="IMRF Award nomination certificate" title="IMRF Award nomination certificate" /></p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/21</strong>: "Saving lives is not a crime." - United Nations in Geneva</h4>

<p>The United Nations have called on Italy to respect human rights and not to interfere with rescue organizations. <br />
In a detailed letter from eleven Special Rapporteurs, the UN calls on Italy not to further criminalize humanitarian aid and abide by international rules.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23908&amp;LangID=E">Statement of the UN</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/21</strong>: Jugend Rettet IUVENTA stands in solidarity with SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders</h4>

<p>"This is another strike in the series of attacks criminalising humanitarian aid at sea. The tragic current situation is leading to an absence of humanitarian search and rescue vessels operating in the central Mediterranean, while the mortality rate is on the rise" says Frederic Penard, SOS MEDITERRANEE Head of Operations. <br />
We stand in solidarity with SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders. Following the seizure of the IUVENTA and ongoing investigations against our crew, the Italian criminalization campaign reaches yet another peak of absurdity.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/13</strong>: "Investigations against private maritime rescuers" - report in the NDR</h4>

<p>The Italian public prosecutor investigates 10 former crew members of our ship, the IUVENTA. <br />
They talked about it with the NDR.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/11</strong>: Death toll for crossing the Mediterranean has risen almost twelve-fold compared to September of last two years</h4>

<p><img src="../f/images/archive/20181111_001.jpg" alt="Chart death rates" title="Chart death rates" /></p>

<p>The death toll for crossing the Mediterranean has increased almost twelve-fold compared to September of the last two years.</p>

<p>We demand: A government rescue program and an immediate end to the criminalization of humanitarian aid. To guarantee safe escape routes for all people.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/11/04</strong>: Donation and information booth at the "Konzert-Klangbrücke Afrika-Europa" in Herzogenrath</h4>

<p>At the "Konzert-Klangbrücke Afrika-Europa" in Herzogenrath we collected donations for our work. In addition, Eddi Hüneke (formerly Wise Guys), Petra Jansen (singer and journalist) and Warnee Poland (guitarist, among others, the Nina Hagen Band) spoke with our ambassadors about our work. It was a nice evening and we would like to thank the Eurode Youth Orchestra Herzogenrath for the invitation and the beautiful music!</p>

<h4><strong>2018/10/29</strong>: Participation in podium of the European Graduate School</h4>

<p>Clemens sat on the podium at the European Graduate School and, together with other SAR experts, including Charles Heller of Forensic Architecture and Tamino of Sea-Watch, discussed the current situation of the SAR organizations.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/10/29</strong>: Our IUVENTA is chained for 453 days</h4>

<p>For at least two years, Italian authorities are using the toughest means, such as eavesdropping telephones, listening bugs and smuggling covert investigators on other ships against us, without providing punishable evidence.
For 453 days we could have saved people on the Mediterranean.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/10/27</strong>: Roller Derby in Potsdam</h4>

<p>Paws up for the cats! Thank you Prussian Fat Cats - Roller Derby Potsdam for the invitation to the Derby - rolling against racism &amp; for #freeIUVENTA!</p>

<h4><strong>2018/10/14</strong>: Interview with Captain Pia at Phoenix</h4>

<p>Captain Pia also participated in two missions at the IUVENTA. She and nine other crew members are being investigated in Italy. In the interview with PHOENIX she talks about her motivation to continue anyway. Thank you for your commitment!</p>

<h4><strong>2018/10/12</strong>: Jugend RETTET IUVENTA participates at "unteilbar" Demonstration in Berlin</h4>

<h4><strong>2018/09/29</strong>: Jugend RETTET IUVENTA participates at "We'll come united" Demonstration in Hamburg</h4>

<h4><strong>2018/09/20</strong>: Position paper for summit in Salzburg</h4>

<p>The motto of the EU summit in Salzburg "a Europe that protects" must not mean that only Europeans are protected. Isolation and the refusal to accept responsibility for those European values is a betrayal for the people in need of protection.
Together with Sea-Watch, LIFELINE, Solidarity at sea, sea-eye and borderline europe - Menschenrechte ohne Grenzen e.V. we developed a position paper: <a href="../f/files/Position_Paper_20_09_18.pdf">Link</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/09/13</strong>: Participation in conference "Sea Rescue in the Mediterranean" at the Bundestag</h4>

<p>We were participating with many colleagues in the conference "Sea Rescue in the Mediterranean" at the Bundestag in Berlin and discussed the criminalization of search and rescue: We finally need an end of the European policy of isolation!</p>

<h4><strong>2018/09/07</strong>: Nationwide participation in protests of "Seebrücke - Schafft sichere Häfen" ("pier - create safe havens")</h4>

<p>Our embassy network is growing steadily and we are very grateful to each one of them. In these hard times, there are still many young people who can not simply watch as people drown, but the idea of practical solidarity moves them to action. <br />
Therefore many are very active nationwide at "Seebrücke - Schafft sichere Häfen" ("pier - create safe havens"). 
At the European Protest Week in Munich, Bremen, Cologne, Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin and Bonn we were again numerously represented.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/08/24</strong>: Technical inspection of our IUVENTA</h4>

<p>Our IUVENTA does not give up! <br />
After a long wait we were finally able to do a short technical inspection yesterday and visit our ship. Contrary to our fears, the old lady shows very resistant and bravely fighting against rust and seawater. <br />
We'll take an example and continue to fight. For it is also our world in which human dignity suddenly seems to be negotiable again. We as young Europeans have a different idea of what a liveable and caring society looks like. And an idea is not as easy to chain as a ship.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/08/02</strong>: Confiscation of our IUVENTA anniversary</h4>

<p>One year. Our ship is in chains in Trapani, while dying in the Mediterranean continues - the death rate is higher than in years. We could be there now and save lives. Where is our ship?</p>

<p><img src="../f/images/archive/20180802_001.jpg" alt="Where is our ship?" title="Where is our ship?" /></p>

<h4><strong>2018/07/31</strong>: Italian ship illegally returns rescued shipwrecked to Libya</h4>

<p>Yesterday, an Italian ship brought rescued shipwrecked people back to Libya - an illegal push-back action that leaves us speechless and angry. <br />
Already in 2012, the ECtHR ruled that repelling people to Libya was illegal. For years, affected persons, NGOs, even German ambassadors have reported on the inhumane conditions in Libyan internment camps: violence, forced labor, rape and executions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/31/italian-ship-returned-rescued-people-to-libya-charity-says">Report in The Guardian</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/07/31</strong>: Donation from pupils of the Friedrich-List-Gymnasium</h4>

<p>We are overwhelmed: The pupils of the Friedrich-List-Gymnasium have been awarded the Würzburg Peace Prize 2018 for their project Krass at the FLG-Gemünden and have collected more than 700€ for Jugend RETTET during the event: "We (... ) hope that IUVENTA can soon set sail again to save more human lives." Thank you!</p>

<h4><strong>2018/07/30</strong>: Open letter to the UNHCR</h4>

<p>Today, together with other NGOs active in the Mediterranean, we have written an open letter to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. We expect the UNHCR to fulfill its most important task: the protection of refugees.</p>

<p><a href="../f/Open_Letter_UNHCR.pdf">Open letter</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/07/29</strong>: Support on the day of maritime rescue</h4>

<p>Thank you Sea-Watch, sea-eye and Mission Lifeline for thinking of us and for your continued support! We hope that you and we can set sail again soon! <br />
Especially on the day of maritime rescue the EU should not stop us, but support us in what we do!</p>

<p><a href="../f/files/PM_090718_ENGL_web.pdf">After the rescue ship IUVENTA of Jugend Rettet e.V. has been detained under the
pretext of a preventive seizure last August, the Italian public prosecutor's office is now expanding
its investigations against individual crew members of the organization. The criminalization of
search and rescue organizations with the aim of a complete isolation of Europe shows once again
its cruel and deterrent face.</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/06/24 Joint Statement</strong>: Stop the Externalisation of European Borders</h4>

<p>The civil rescue fleet urges the EU and its member states to stop the
ongoing externalisation of their borders, carried out through a policy of containment of
migration and pull-backs by proxy. Instead of focusing on the criminalisation of the civil
rescue NGOs, we ask for solidarity amongst the European states (Art. 80 TFUE) and towards
the people in need of international protection.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/06/22 PRESS RELEASE</strong>: NEW THREATENING GESTURES OF THE ITALIAN INTERIOR MINISTER AGAINST GERMAN MARITIME RESCUE ORGANIZATIONS</h4>

<p><a href="../f/files/JR_PM_20180622_ENG.pdf">Matteo Salvini's ambitions to close down Italian ports as a place of safety for NGO vessels and to hamper the work of NGOs, as well as to reduce rescue capacity, cost numerous lives again.</a></p>

<h4><strong>2018/04/24</strong> Objection against seizure of IUVENTA rejected.</h4>

<p>The First Criminal Section of the Cassation Court in Rome rejects 
objection to the seizure of IUVENTA by Jugend Rettet e.V. Despite the lack of evidence 
for the allegations against the organization and high death toll on the central 
Mediterranean route, the IUVENTA until further notice will not be able to operate. <br />
A more detailed explanation of the decision is currently pending.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/04/23</strong> Decision to release IUVENTA will be announced tomorrow morning.</h4>

<p>The Cassation Court in Rome held this morning, but no decision has yet been announced. For our lawyers, it is clear that the allegations that have already been refuted by external experts do not meet the criteria for seizure of IUVENTA. By this evening, the judges will have made a decision. We will be informed of the outcome of the decision tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Following statement can be signed on <a href="https://right2rescue.org/en/">right2rescue.org</a>:</p>

<h4><strong>2018/04/17</strong> Decision on the release of our IUVENTA on April 23rd in Rome</h4>

<p>The decision on the release of our IUVENTA will take place on April 23rd in Rome.
973 people have died on the central Mediterranean route since the day of the, August 2nd.
No evidence against us, nor against individual crew members is available to date.
Various experts refuted the allegations of the Italian prosecutor.</p>

<p>If valid law will be spoken, then from April 23rd we can continue to do what we have been convinced of since the beginning: saving people from distress.</p>

<h4><strong>2018/03/18</strong> Ship of Proactiva Open Arms confiscated</h4>

<p>As a matter of course state repressions against unpleasant NGOs are taking place in Europe: on  August 2nd 2017, the IUVENTA was confiscated by the Italian authorities. To date, there are no charges against the organization or individuals. On March 18th, 2018, the ship of Proactiva Open Arms was detained. Instead of relying on constructive solutions in migration policy based on existing law and humanitarian values, the EU is simply trying to close the Central Mediterranean route by all means. The fact that the European Contracting States thereby break with international and human rights agreements, by people being rejected to Libya, is apparently accepted as well as the European cooperation with criminal structures in Libya. Human rights are valid for all people, irrespective of their legal status - and the criminalization of the people who support these rights is an intolerable situation.</p>

<h4><strong>Mar. 13th:</strong> Case IUVENTA: Appointment at the Supreme Court of Cassation</h4>

<p>On April 23rd the court in Rome will decide on the release of our Iuventa. On that day we will go into second instance against the seizure and demand the immediate return of our rescue ship. We are certain that the allegations of the public prosecutor's office lack any legal basis, that our crews have always adhered to applicable law and have worked in a highly professional manner and that they have done nothing wrong. Over the last few months, we have had the allegations repeatedly reviewed not only internally but also externally, and the interviewed experts agree with us on all points raised, which prove our innocence. That is why 8 months after the confiscation we are sure: The Iuventa must be released. <br />
In addition to the encouragement of international organizations and experts, we are especially encouraged by you! <br />
The confiscation as a legal instrument is a political measure. We will not accept that. We are not alone in our fight. Together with other organizations, we not only fight for our Iuventa, but also for a humane right of migration! We say: #freeiuventa! #RechtaufFlucht!</p>

<h4><strong>Feb. 27th:</strong> Sea rescue NGOs present Joint Statement in Brussels</h4>

<p>The central Mediterranean route is still the most dangerous escape route in the world. Criminalization of rescues and escape do not provide any relief. In Brussels, we have now submitted a joint statement to the EU. What would speak against these points? Together with borderline europe -  Menschenrechte ohne Grenzen e.V., Watch The Med - Alarmphone, Sea-Watch, LIFELINE Salvamento Marítimo Humanitario and RESQSHIP we ask the EU: Are we the scapegoats of the failed EU policy?</p>

<h4><strong>December 3rd-4th</strong> Crew meeting in Berlin</h4>

<p>Our crews were able to save 6.526 lives. We all met last weekend again to evaluate the missions and to optimize our processes. Our common goal is less deaths in the Mediterranean.</p>

<h4><strong>December 1st</strong> We do not want gifts</h4>

<p>Dear EU, we have a Christmas wish: we want a state sea rescue program. We are pupils, trainees and students. We are simply young people. We want you to rescue people in maritime emergency on the Mediterranean. With numerous supporters we were able to rescue more than 6500 lives from drowning. We need any support, because you, dear EU, you will probably not fulfill our Christmas wish.  We do not want gifts. We want fewer deaths.</p>

<h4><strong>November 29th</strong> The IUVENTA reached her winter storage in Croatia</h4>

<p>The IUVENTA reached her winter storage in Croatian. She'll get reconstructed again in February as we need a new crane and also new dinghies. Furthermore we want to use our crews' experience to adjust her for the rescues. With our colleagues of Rainbow for Africa we optimize our hospital for a more efficient medical care. Next spring she'll head for the Med again.</p>

<h4><strong>November 23rd</strong> 6.526 saved lives</h4>

<p>With Mission Diversity our last mission for this year is over. We were able to accomplish seven missions in 2016. Thank you very, very much to everyone who was a part of our crews. You made our theoretical considerations come true and saved 6.526 lives. Furthermore we would like to say thank you to everyone who helped that the Iuventa is a rescue ship now: our numerous donors, everyone who helped during the resconstruction and also a big thank you to our ambassadors and ambassadresses who do not only make sure Jugend Rettet gets more and more popular, but also collected so many donations. From the first day on, Jugend Rettet was for everyone to participate and we're grateful and proud what we achieved together. THANK YOU!</p>

<h4><strong>November 23rd</strong> Mission Diversity done</h4>

<p>Our crew of Mission Diversity is back safe and sound. Guys, thank you so much for your great effort and the rescue of 393 lives! </p>

<h4><strong>November 17th</strong> 100 people rescued</h4>

<p>This morning the MRCC called our crew to an emergency situation with 100 people on a rubber boad. Despite severe weather conditions with 1.5 - 2 metre high waves, the rescue went well and everyone came on board safely. </p>

<h4><strong>November 15th</strong> Tough rescue with many deaths</h4>

<p>The Iuventa is currently together with the Maersk Erin in a difficult use - A rubber boat capsized. The 23 survivors are on board of the Maersk Erin. 100 people are missing. The crews are searching for survivors in the water and recovering dead bodies.
Our thoughts are with the victims and everyone involved of this catastrophe.</p>

<h4><strong>November 14th</strong> Ambassadors from Engstingen collect 3066,93€</h4>

<p>Our two ambassadors for Engstingen, Aron and Jeremias, started their first big campaign at different schools last weekend. This brought together 3066,95€!  We're very proud of these two and grateful for anyone who donated so generously. Great Work!</p>

<h4><strong>November 12th</strong> 140 people rescued</h4>

<p>140 people were rescued today. Among them two pregnants. Our medical team of R4A took care of them and further supplied several burns, one broken arm and a girl with fever. The Aquarius of SOS MEDITERRANEE took all of them on board. Furthermore our crew was a part of saving six rubber boats yesterday. More info to come.</p>

<h4><strong>November 11th</strong> Mission Diversity leaves Valletta</h4>

<p>Our seventh and therefore last crew for this year left Valletta last night. The mission runs under the name Diversity. Cultural diversity mustn't be a reason for fear and origin must never be a reason for hate. Diversity doesn't take anything from us. To us diversity is the big gain for a society. Willingness to a diverse society is characterised by welcoming of people with open arms instead of defending borders. As different as we all may be, the ability to act human unites us all.</p>

<h4><strong>November 10th</strong> 2016 deadliest year for refugees on the Med</h4>

<p>"More than 4.200 people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean this year or are missing. Already two months before the end of the year, 2016 is the year with most deaths in the Mediterranean. (...) Each and single one of these people have a story and a face. They escape wars, discrimination, violence and the lack of resources."
We demand the EU to overtake responsibility!

<h4><strong>November 10th</strong> Andronikos' circumnavigation around the island of Lesbos ended</h4>

<p>Yesterday Andronikos' circumnavigation around the island of Lesbos ended - for the moment. His autumn holidays are over and Andronikos has to return to school. He is, however, planning to complete the rest of his circumnavigation in his Christmas holidays. An exciting and successful week is over: he sailed from Molivos in the north of the island to the small village of Nifida on the Gulf of Kaloni in the south. One night Andronikos spent with young refugees in their quaters. His commitment and solidarity is admirable. Thank you, Andronikos!</p>

<h4><strong>November 7th</strong> Skipper Uli passes the commando to Kai</h4>

<p>After four missions our Skipper Uli passes the IUVENTA over to our new Skipper Kai.
Thank you very, very much for your great engagement and perseverance, Uli!  All the best to Kai and thank you for your support!</p>

<h4><strong>November 6th</strong> Mission Dignity completed - 2733 people rescued</h4>

<p>The mission was unbelievably demanding, mentally as physically, long stretches without any sleep, but yet with indescribable success. Within seven operating days we were able to save 2733 lives, of which we gave 1293 people protection on board of the IUVENTA, medical supply, water and food. Our medical team of Rainbow 4 Africa took care of bullet wounds, complicated fractures, heavily pregnants in critical condition and numerous - partly severe - combustions. Some cases of seasickness were successfully treated, too. Two female patients urgently had to get picked up by a helicopter of the Italian marine and were brought to a hospital on Malta. Again all boats were overloaded and therefore in a critical condition. The tubes of several boats collapsed due to too much weight. Luckily our RIB was always on-site to rescue the people quickly and safely. As it already happened during Mission Unity, the boats appeared at any day and night time, which lead to search and rescue even when it was pitch black. Together with our two RIBs we managed to find every boat and rescue everyone.
We can not say thank you enough to our crew of Mission Dignity. We're proud of you!</p>

<h4><strong>November 4th</strong> 840 people rescued</h4>

<p>Since 2am our crew is in use again. An emergency call from the MRCC woke the crew to take their position. With many lookouts, our dinghy in the water and the help of the Bourbon Argos (MSF) we managed to discover the first boat and supplied everyone with life jackets. The Bourbon Argos took everyone on board. According to the people they started with two boats, so we continued the search for the second one. Almost simultaneously another call from the MRCC came in to tell us about another boat. It was sighted north of the 15nm zone and got supplied with life jackets, too. The Bourbon Argos took all of them on board again.  09:55am ... 6 rubber boats later. The Iuventa, Minden (LifeBoat), Bourbon Argos and Topaz Responder (MOAS) are still in use. The Iuventa took 140 people on board. All in all 840 were rescued within 8 hours. Right now our RIB is shuttling people from a rubber boat to Topaz Responder. The LCG is assisting them.</p>

<h4><strong>November 3rd</strong> Rescue of 420 people</h4>

<p>UNHCR informs that 239 people are missing after the catastrophe between Libya and Italy yesterday evening. Today was a rough day as well. Our crew of „Mission Dignity“ assisted rescuing 420 people from maritime emergency. All passengers were brought to the Phoenix of MOAS safely.  Right now our crew is still busy with ongoing rescue missions. Catastrophes like the one that happened yesterday can be avoided: By safe and legal passages! We demand action from European governments and the civil society right now!</p>

<h4><strong>October 28th</strong> 15-year-old Greek starts charity circumnavigation</h4>

<p>The 15-year-old Andronikus, so far the youngest supporter of Jugend Rettet e.V., will start a symbolic charity circumnavigation of his native island Lesbos on 28th October 2016 to draw attention to the dying on the Mediterranean. "With my circumnavigation I would like to help Jugend Rettet to proceed with their missions successfully, because every person in maritime emergency deserves rescue. Each of us can support this in his or her way through actions like this or through donations. Jugend Rettet shows this in a way that impressed me deeply and will be an example for me for a lifetime,“ Andronikos explains.</p>

<h4><strong>October 27th</strong> More rescues</h4>

<p>The current situation on the Mediterranean can hardly be described. Not a day goes by without at least one rescue and our crew gets hardly any time to rest and recover from these strenuous missions. Due to extreme weather conditions the situation gets more and more dangerous for the fleeing, too.
Our crew took 169 people from a rubber and a wooden boat on board yesterday. One person could only be brought out of the rubber boat dead. Furthermore our team helped retrieving one more corpse out of the water.
Only 2h after finishing their use and the guests got handed over for their transport to the VOS Hestia, another emergency call reached our crew of Mission Dignity. Since this night the Iuventa is in use with again 280 between 300 guets on board. Among them two pregnant women, about to give birth.</p>

<h4><strong>October 25th</strong> Mission Dignity in continuous use</h4>

<p>As soon as our crew of reached the SAR zone they were is in continuous use. Already on sunday an emergency call about two rubber boats reached the crew. Luckily both boats were stable. We distributed life jackets and took all 279 people on board. Unfortunately there were many dehydrated and exhausted people as well as persons with severe burns so that our medical team of Rainbow4Africa was very busy. Due to long discussions with the MRCC in Rome it took a while until we had a solution to transport the rescued. Only at five past ten in the evening the rescued got handed over to the Spanish coast guard. We wish everyone an onward journey.  Yesterday 268 people were taken on board and handed over to a Maltese warship shortly after midnight. Only 15 minutes later the next emergency call came in.  All the other NGOs are in continuous use, too. Unbelievable that private organizations have to do all this work.</p>

<h4><strong>October 21st</strong> Start of Mission Dignity</h4>

<p>"Human dignity is inviolable" that's how it is written in Article 1 of the Constitution. It's hard to trust this sentence, while the European Union forces people to take such a dangerous rout like the one via the Mediterranean. This why we try to at least keep a little dignity alive by not letting them drown. We see it as our duty to support people on the run instead of turning away from them. To safe and respect the dignity of every single human also means to avoid shocking pictures of people in the water who fear for their lives.</p>

<h4><strong>October 14th</strong> Mission Unity finished</h4>

<p>Welcome back to our amazing crew of Mission Unity! Thank you for your great effort and the rescue of 423 lives.</p>

<h4><strong>October 14th</strong> 148 people rescued</h4>

<p>130 people were held by our crew of the current mission Unity from a rubber boat and another 18 from a wooden boat. Our crew supplied them with water, food and medicine. We wish them all the best for their future.</p>

<h4><strong>October 12th</strong> Rescue under difficult conditions</h4>

<p>In the night of the 12th to 13th October our crew was part of rescuing 126 people. The rescue was not only because it was pitch black outside extremely difficult, but also due to high waves and strong wind. The weather pushed the rubber boat back into Libyan territorial waters. Yet there was not much time to think as MOAS drone showed that one tube already bursted and people slipped into the water. Together with Proactiva, Boat Refugee Foundation and MOAS our RIB shuttled the rescued to the Phoenix. 17 people, among them a four-year old could not get rescued.</p>

<h4><strong>October 7th</strong> Rescue of 132 people</h4>

<p>132 people were saved from a robber boat - among them a family with four kids, who were extremely happy about their new cuddly toys.</p>

<h4><strong>October 5th</strong> Rescue of 30 people</h4>

<p>30 people, who were on a wooden boat, were rescued by our crew of Mission Unity 50nm off the Libyan coast. The people were already at sea for two days. At some point the motor broke. Everyone was taken on board of the Iuventa, where they also spent the night until they were handed over to the Italian coast guard. </p>

<h4><strong>October 4th</strong> Start of Mission Unity</h4>

<p>As part of the the Day of Reunification of Germany, we want it to point out that borders - if they are in the heads of people or on maps - can never justify that people have to fear for their lives. As a group of young Europeans we trust in the power of a unified European commitment. We need to hold on to our democratic and humanitarian values which are unfortunately at the moment too often discussed and questioned.</p>

<h4><strong>October 4th</strong> Photos of Mission Humanity</h4>

<p>On our last mission, Mission Humanity, we had Zohra Bensemra by Reuters on board, whose images have been published on Reuters and were also conducted during the last week under the heading "Pictures of the day" at The Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://de.reuters.com/news/picture/migrants-plucked-from-overloaded-dinghy?articleId=UKRTSOT3O" target="_blank">http://de.reuters.com/news/picture/migrants-plucked-from-overloaded-dinghy?articleId=UKRTSOT3O</a></p>

<p>Our crew of Mission Humanity came back to Malta safe and sound. Thank you very much for your great effort and the rescue of 131 people. </p>

<h4><strong>September 21st</strong> 131 people rescued</h4>

<p>Despite moderate weather, a couple of boats left Libya yesterday.</p>

<p>Our crew of Mission Humanity supplied one rubber boat with life jackets and took all 131 people on board of the IUVENTA. Among them twelve women, no children.</p>

<p>Our medical team treated two gunshot wounds and in spite of the circumstances, everyone was well.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon our crew handed the rescued over to Save the Children, who took everyone safely to Italy.</p>

<p>With Humanity we express our empathy for people on the run and the effort for the unlimited equivalence of all individuals. Especially people on the move should rate high within our society instead of being stigmatized. We demand the decriminalization of fleeing people as well as support and equal opportunity.</p>

<h4><strong>September 12th</strong> 1,454 lives saved by Mission Responsibility</h4>

<p>Within only one week our crew was a part of saving 1.454 lives. You already know about the first rescue where 280 people were rescued last Monday. Additionally our crew supplied 6 rubber boats with each 150 people from which our crew took 440 on board of the IUVENTA on Saturday.</p>

<p>On Sunday they were able to save 74 people of which 12 were children from wooden boats. Also on Sunday our dinghies rescued 200 people from an overcrowded rubber boat and handed them over the Boat Refugee Foundation. The crew reported that the people were in a very poor condition.</p>

<h4><strong>September 12th</strong> Crew 3 arrives in Valletta</h4>

<p>The IUVENTA is now back to Malta. We thank our crew of Mission Responsibility for their great effort.</p>

<p>Crew member Kathrin about the operation: "When everyone wears their life jackets, it's time to breathe for the first time."</p>

<h4><strong>September 5th</strong> First rescue of Mission Responsibility</h4>

<p>Our crew of Mission Responsibility rescued serveral boats with people in need for protection together with Proactiva and Moas. All in all the IUVENTA took 280 people from two rubber boats on board. 228 men, 48 women (of which nine were pregnant) and four children. The people got supplied with medical care and fresh clothes. <br />

<h4><strong>September 1st</strong> Start of Mission Responsibility</h4>

<p>Our crew of Mission Responsibility leaves Malta today to start their operation. We wish you strength and are grateful for your valuable service.
We decided on the name Responsibility as the organization, our crews, our ambassadors and our donors take responsibility instead of looking away. When people are forced to take such a dangerous escape route as there aren't any legal possibilities then the only thing left to say is that states fail to render assistance. #safepassage</p>

Now they're back in Malta safe and sound. Thank you for your effort! #missionequality</p>

<h4><strong>August 5th</strong> Mission Equality starts</h4>

<p>Our second crew left Valetta for the SAR-zone today at noon. We named the mission Equality as we stand up for everyone having equal rights. Everyone in maritime emergency deserves rescue, regardless how they got there and where they come from.</p>

<h4><strong>August 5th</strong> Mission Solidarity completed</h4>
